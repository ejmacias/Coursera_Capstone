In this project, we tackle the problem of a low-cost supermarket chain trying to decide in which area of Madrid (Spain) they should open their new store in order to maximise the revenue. It is important to note that the city of Madrid consists of 21 districts and 131 neighbourhoods with great differences between them.

This project was done for the course Applied Data Science Capstone from Coursera.

File structure:
- /files: Input files containing data about the Madrid city census.
- /img: Images for the report.
- report.pdf: Full report.
- store_locations.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the sourcecode of this project.
