    "In this project, we tackle the problem of a low-cost supermarket chain trying to decide in which area of Madrid (Spain) they should open their new store in order to maximise the revenue. It is important to note that the city of Madrid consists of 21 districts and 131 neighbourhoods with great differences between them. \n",

In the other hand, a large proportion of supermarkets over the rest of food venues might indicate it is a residential area where people normally make their food shopping.\n",
